"# UrbanDense5GSim" 

This project simulates an urban dense 5G network topology using the Simu5G framework, specifically focusing on scenarios involving Sub-6 GHz and mmWave spectrums. The network comprises key components like a central gNodeB, User Equipments (UEs), background traffic cells for interference testing, and various configurations for carrier aggregation and variable numerology.
